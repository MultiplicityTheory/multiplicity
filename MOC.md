                                              Abstract

         Multiplicity Operator Calculus (MOC) formalizes a non-reductive, prime-indexed
      framework for modeling interdependent processes on hypergraphs. Inspired by the recursive
      epistemologies of Eastern mathematics, MOC treats number not as abstraction but as
      relational operator. Each prime 𝑝 defines a family of noncommuting operators 𝑃ˆ 𝑝 that
      act simultaneously on nodes and relations, generating nested cycles of resonance and
      transformation. The calculus unites rhythmic, geometric, and symbolic domains by
                                                                    Î ˆ𝑘𝑝
      encoding process structure through factorization: composition  𝑃 𝑝 represents both
      algebraic and temporal layering. Unlike linear differential or matrix approaches, MOC
      prioritizes recursive flows over static state evolution, enabling the modeling of systems
      whose coherence depends on rhythmic resonance rather than equilibrium. Applications span
      symbolic computation, musical architecture, prime-based synchronization networks, and
      ethical or cognitive dynamics in recursive agent systems. This paper develops the algebraic
      rules, commutation relations, and resonance functionals defining the MOC and demonstrates
      its use through a 108-cycle operator construct embodying binary–ternary interplay.

Keywords: multiplicity, hypergraph dynamics, prime operators, resonance, recursion, noncom-
mutative systems


Executive Summary

Problem Statement and Motivation
Classical models privilege objects and linear evolution; relations are secondary and often fixed.
Many real systems—symbolic, musical, cognitive, ethical—exhibit coherence through nested

                                                  1
cycles and context-sensitive coupling that standard differential or matrix methods capture only
indirectly. We seek a calculus where relations and rhythmic structure are primary, and where
number encodes process rather than quantity.


Core Contribution
We introduce the Multiplicity Operator Calculus (MOC): a prime-indexed, noncommutative
operator framework acting on states and hyperedges of a hypergraph. For each prime 𝑝, a family
{ 𝑃ˆ 𝑝 } generates subdivision, rotation, accent, and permutation modes whose compositions realize
nested periodicities. Validation is resonance-based: a functional

                                            ˆ 𝐷) ∈ [0, 1]
                                     𝑅(𝐻, { 𝑃};

measures fit between modeled structure and target data 𝐷 (e.g., cycles in time series, phrase
boundaries, or symbolic constraints). As an exemplar, we construct a full 𝑛 = 108 = 22 · 33
operator word that integrates ternary phrasing with binary micro-pulse.


Key Results and Applications
    • Algebra: Closed rules for composition, lifting across prime powers, and cross-prime braid
      relations; normal forms up to phase equivalence.
    • Resonance: Practical criteria and algorithms to maximize 𝑅, enabling “proof by resonance”
      for pattern adequacy.
    • 108-cycle: A transparent build demonstrating how factorization sets macro–micro coupling
      and how operator order controls feel.
    • Applications: (i) symbolic computation via rewrite orchestration on hypergraphs; (ii)
      musical architecture and metrical design; (iii) synchronization networks with prime-gated
      stability; (iv) cognitive/ethical policy constraints modeled as conserved quantities under
      𝑃ˆ 𝑝 .

Philosophical and Historical Context

Eastern Mathematics: Recursion, Relational Ontology, and Sutra Logic
In the intellectual traditions of India, China, and East Asia, mathematics evolved within a
relational and recursive ontology rather than a mechanistic one. Number was conceived not
as abstraction but as expression of interdependence. The Vedic and Buddhist doctrines of
Pratı̄tyasamutpāda (dependent origination) and the Taoist notion of the Ten Thousand Things
unfolding from the One describe multiplicity as an emergent unity: relations produce entities,
not the reverse.
    Mathematical reasoning in these contexts operated through sutra logic—compact aphorisms
encoding recursive procedures. Each sutra functioned simultaneously as algorithm, mnemonic,
and cosmological statement. Knowledge was revealed through iterative interpretation, not static
proof. Recursion served as epistemic method and ontological model.


Multiplicity Versus Reduction: Relations-First Stance
Western formalism tends toward reduction: decomposing wholes into independent parts and
reassembling them through linear rules. Multiplicity theory in the Eastern sense reverses this
orientation. It begins with networks of mutual conditioning where nodes have no existence apart
from their connective roles. This relations-first stance treats mathematics as a mirror of dynamic
balance rather than a tool of dissection.
    Within this view, multiplicity is not numerical excess but structured co-arising. A number
such as 108 = 22 · 33 is not a mere product; it encodes nested rhythmic and symbolic layers.
Prime factors act as archetypal generators of relational order.


Symbolic Cycles in Practice: Calendar, Breath, Music, and Ritual
Traditional applications of Eastern mathematical ideas are found in cyclical systems. Calendrical
computation linked celestial periodicities with ritual timing. Yogic and Daoist practices mapped
breathing rhythms and bodily cycles to integer ratios. Classical Indian and East Asian music
employed binary and ternary meter interlocks, structurally analogous to prime decomposition.
Temple geometry, mandala construction, and mantra recitation all used numerical proportion as
a mode of synchronization between microcosm and macrocosm.
    These practices embody recursion physically: repetition with modulation, symmetry with
deviation, and invariance through transformation. Mathematical order thus operated as a lived
rhythm, not an abstract invariant.

Operationalization in This Report
The Multiplicity Operator Calculus formalizes these principles in algebraic and computational
language. Primes become operators 𝑃ˆ 𝑝 acting recursively on hypergraphs; factorization
corresponds to hierarchical cycles. Resonance replaces proof: coherence is verified when
generated patterns align with empirical or symbolic cycles.
   This report translates the philosophical motifs of recursion, interdependence, and cyclic
symmetry into a rigorous operator framework. By embedding the relational ontology of Eastern
mathematics into prime-indexed dynamics, it unites metaphysical intuition with executable
formalism—an explicit bridge between symbolic cosmology and algorithmic modeling.


Preliminaries and Notation

Time Lattice
Let the discrete cyclic time domain be

                                T𝑛 = Z/𝑛Z = {0, 1, . . . , 𝑛 − 1},

which serves as the base lattice for periodic processes of length 𝑛. Arithmetic on T𝑛 is taken
modulo 𝑛. Each tick 𝑡 ∈ T𝑛 represents a phase position within a closed cycle.


Signals and Patterns
A signal or pattern is a function
                                         𝑥 : T𝑛 → R 𝑘 ,

where 𝑘 denotes the number of feature channels (e.g., amplitude, color, intensity, or symbolic
value). The space of all such signals is X𝑛 = {𝑥 : T𝑛 → R 𝑘 }, equipped with pointwise addition
and scalar multiplication, forming a real vector space.


Hypergraph Structure
The relational substrate of multiplicity is modeled as a hypergraph

                                         𝐻 = (𝑉, 𝐸, 𝜄),

where 𝑉 is the set of vertices (states), 𝐸 the set of hyperedges (relations), and 𝜄 : 𝐸 → P (𝑉)
the incidence map assigning to each edge its participating vertices. Unlike a standard graph,
hyperedges may connect any number of vertices, representing higher-order relations.




                                                4
    Each vertex 𝑣 ∈ 𝑉 and hyperedge 𝑒 ∈ 𝐸 carries state attachments

                                   𝜎 : 𝑉 → R𝑘 ,          𝜏 : 𝐸 → R𝑚 ,

encoding local and relational attributes. Operators will act jointly on (𝜎, 𝜏), allowing transfor-
mation of both nodes and the relations that bind them.


Operator Words and Composition Order
An operator word is an ordered product of prime-indexed operators:

                   W = 𝑂ˆ 𝑚 𝑂ˆ 𝑚−1 · · · 𝑂ˆ 1 ,      𝑂ˆ 𝑖 ∈ { 𝑃ˆ (𝑟)
                                                                 𝑝 : 𝑝 prime, 𝑟 ≥ 1}.


Application is right-to-left:

                                𝑥 ′ = W [𝑥] = 𝑂ˆ 𝑚 (𝑂ˆ 𝑚−1 (· · · 𝑂ˆ 1 (𝑥))).

Noncommutativity implies that reordering the same multiset of primes generally produces distinct
outcomes. The set of all operator words with the same prime content forms an equivalence class
under resonance equivalence, denoted [W] 𝑅 .


Divisibility Indicator and Class Labels
For integer divisibility, define the indicator function

                                           
                                            1,
                                           
                                                   if 𝑡 ≡ 0   (mod 𝑑),
                                 [𝑑 | 𝑡] =
                                            0,
                                                   otherwise.
                                           

This binary function allows the construction of hierarchical accent and phase structures. Given a
cycle length 𝑛 and a set of divisors {𝑑𝑖 } ⊆ N, we may assign each tick 𝑡 ∈ T𝑛 a class label

                                      𝐶 (𝑡) = {𝑑𝑖 : [𝑑𝑖 | 𝑡] = 1},

representing its membership in overlapping rhythmic or symbolic strata. For example, in 𝑛 = 108,
the classes corresponding to 𝑑 = 2, 3, 9, 27 define binary and ternary accent layers.
    These primitives provide the syntactic foundation for the Multiplicity Operator Calcu-
lus: signals live on the lattice T𝑛 , relations inhabit 𝐻, and operator words encode recursive
transformations whose resonance properties are analyzed in later sections.

Multiplicity Space and Carriers

Definition of the Multiplicity Space
The fundamental carrier of the Multiplicity Operator Calculus is the multiplicity space

                                         M = (X, 𝐻),

where X denotes the signal space X𝑛 = {𝑥 : T𝑛 → R𝑘 } and 𝐻 = (𝑉, 𝐸, 𝜄) is the hypergraph of
relational topology introduced previously.
    Elements of M therefore encode both local states and relational structure. Operators 𝑃ˆ (𝑟)
                                                                                            𝑝
act simultaneously on these two layers:

                                  𝑃ˆ (𝑟)             ′   ′
                                     𝑝 : (X, 𝐻) −→ (X , 𝐻 ),


where X ′ and 𝐻 ′ denote the updated state and hypergraph under a prime-indexed transformation
(e.g., subdivision, rotation, or permutation). Each M is thus a dynamic carrier—its internal
organization may change while preserving coherence through resonance invariants.


Automorphisms and Gauge Perspective
The internal symmetries of the multiplicity space form the automorphism group

           Aut(M) = { (𝜙𝑉 , 𝜙 𝐸 ) | 𝜙𝑉 : 𝑉 → 𝑉, 𝜙 𝐸 : 𝐸 → 𝐸, 𝜄 ◦ 𝜙 𝐸 = P (𝜙𝑉 ) ◦ 𝜄 },

where P (𝜙𝑉 ) denotes the induced action on subsets of 𝑉. These automorphisms represent
relabelings of vertices and edges that leave the incidence structure invariant.
    From a gauge perspective, each automorphism corresponds to a local symmetry transformation
of the multiplicity field. If (𝜎, 𝜏) are the vertex and edge states, an automorphism acts as

                                  (𝜎, 𝜏) ↦→ (𝑔𝑉 ◦ 𝜎, 𝑔 𝐸 ◦ 𝜏),

with 𝑔𝑉 , 𝑔 𝐸 drawn from a local gauge group 𝐺 (often 𝐺 ⊆ GL(𝑘, R)). The MOC treats
these symmetries as redundancies of description—different coordinate expressions of the same
relational configuration.
    Gauge transformations commuting with all 𝑃ˆ (𝑟)
                                                𝑝 define the stabilizer subgroup Stab𝐺 (M),
corresponding to conserved relational frames.


Invariants and Conservation Constraints
Within each multiplicity space, certain scalar quantities remain invariant under admissible
operator action. These invariants encode conservation of structure and ethics of transformation:

                                               6
    • Energy Invariant:                                ∑︁
                                           𝐸 [𝑥] =            ∥𝑥(𝑡)∥ 2 .
                                                       𝑡∈T𝑛

      Preserved under norm-preserving operators (rotations, permutations).
    • Area or Volume Invariant: For geometric realizations, define
                                                       ∑︁
                                         𝐴[𝜎, 𝜏] =            Vol(𝜄(𝑒)),
                                                       𝑒∈𝐸


      which measures conserved relational “extent.” Sulba-style operators (𝑃ˆ 𝑝 corresponding to
      cut-and-join) maintain 𝐴 constant.
    • Fairness or Ethical Invariant: For systems representing allocations or information flows,

                                         𝐹 [𝜎] = min 𝜎𝑖 /max 𝜎𝑖 ,
                                                       𝑖           𝑖

      quantifies balance among vertices. Operator sets satisfying 𝐹 [𝜎′] ≥ 𝐹 [𝜎] are deemed
      ethically admissible.
    These invariants act as gauge constraints on the permissible dynamics within M. Resonant
evolution respects them automatically: only operator compositions that preserve or restore these
measures yield high resonance 𝑅(M). Thus, the multiplicity space is not merely a passive
container for transformation—it is an active metric field enforcing harmony between algebraic
action and relational integrity.


Prime-Indexed Operator Calculus (MOC)

Operator Families on States
Fix a cycle length 𝑛. All state operators act on 𝑥 ∈ X𝑛 = {𝑥 : T𝑛 → R𝑘 }. Admissibility: S 𝑝 ,
R 𝑝𝑟 , A 𝑝𝑟 are defined when 𝑝 𝑟 | 𝑛; otherwise treat them as virtual refinements with lift–project
(omitted here for brevity).

Subdivision S 𝑝 .   Lifts X𝑛 → X𝑝𝑛 :

                      ( S 𝑝 𝑥)( 𝑝𝑡 + 𝑢) = 𝑥(𝑡),    𝑡 ∈ T𝑛 , 𝑢 ∈ {0, . . . , 𝑝 − 1}.

Accent A𝛼𝑝𝑟 .   Adds a level-𝑝𝑟 gate (or multiplies by a weight). Additive form:

                                 ( A𝛼𝑝𝑟 𝑥)(𝑡) = 𝑥(𝑡) + 𝛼 [ 𝑝𝑟 | 𝑡] 𝑒 1 ,

with [𝑑 | 𝑡] ∈ {0, 1} the divisibility indicator and 𝑒 1 a chosen channel.

Rotation R 𝑝𝑟 .        Cyclic shift aligned to the 𝑝𝑟 -grid:

                                                                        𝑝

Permutation W𝜋𝑝 .           Reorders the 𝑝 subticks inside each parent cell after S 𝑝 . For 𝜋 ∈ 𝑆 𝑝 ,
                                                                             
                                              ( W𝜋𝑝 𝑥)( 𝑝𝑡 + 𝑢) = 𝑥 𝑝𝑡 + 𝜋(𝑢) .


Relation Operators on 𝐻
Let 𝐻 = (𝑉, 𝐸, 𝜄). Relation operators 𝑄ˆ 𝑝 act on incidence while coordinating state attachments
(𝜎, 𝜏).

       split
Split 𝑄ˆ 𝑝 .        Each 𝑒 ∈ 𝐸 becomes 𝑝 siblings 𝑒 (𝑢) with refined incidence:

                   𝜄′ (𝑒 (𝑢) ) = 𝜄(𝑒),       𝑢 = 0, . . . , 𝑝 − 1,                 𝜏′ (𝑒 (𝑢) ) = Refine 𝑝 (𝜏(𝑒), 𝑢).

         merge
Merge 𝑄ˆ 𝑝 . Inverse of split on coherent siblings: 𝑝 edges with identical incidence collapse
to one, 𝜏 aggregated by a conserved rule.

Fold 𝑄ˆ fold
        𝑝 . Quotients a 𝑝-cyclic arrangement of vertices/edges by rotation, enforcing periodic
boundary conditions.

Relabel 𝑄ˆ rel
           𝑝 . Applies an incidence-preserving permutation (𝜙𝑉 , 𝜙 𝐸 ) ∈ Aut(𝐻) constrained to
𝑝-cycles.


Prime Word and Composite Word
For each prime 𝑝 and level 𝑟 ≥ 1, define a prime word
                                                     𝑟
                                                    Ö                 

Noncommutation: Sources and Consequences
Noncommutation arises from three mechanisms:


                                                                           8
(i) Index Lifting.    S 𝑝 changes the lattice on which other operators act:

                                                                ↑𝑝
                                          S 𝑝 A𝑞𝛼𝑟 = A𝑞𝛼𝑟             S𝑝 ,

where ↑𝑝 copies accents to each of the 𝑝 children; generally ≠ A𝑞𝛼𝑟 S 𝑝 for 𝑝 ≠ 𝑞.

(ii) Wreath Action.      W 𝜋𝑝 permutes subticks inside cells, disrupting external gates:

                                      W 𝜋𝑝 A𝑞𝛼𝑟 ≠ A𝑞𝛼𝑟 W 𝜋𝑝       ( 𝑝 ≠ 𝑞).

(iii) Relation–State Coupling. 𝑄ˆ 𝑝 reconfigures 𝐻, which changes how state operators
aggregate over hyperedges; hence [𝑄ˆ 𝑝 , A𝑞𝛼𝑟 ] ≠ 0 in general.
Consequences. Operator order controls macro–micro alignment, syncopation, and resonance.
Normal forms are defined up to phase and gauge:

     W ∼ W ′ ⇐⇒ ∃ 𝑔 ∈ Aut(M) : 𝑔 W = W ′ 𝑔 and 𝑅(W [𝑥]; 𝐷) = 𝑅(W ′ [𝑥]; 𝐷).


CRT Structure and Level Projectors Π 𝑝𝑟
Chinese remainder structure provides a canonical multi-level decomposition:

useful for class labels and discrete cadence marking. The pair (Π 𝑝𝑟 , Δ 𝑝𝑟 ) separates invariant
content at level 𝑝𝑟 from event content at that level, supplying a precise bridge between CRT

Quasi-uniform spread over T𝑛 with long-return asymmetry; no collisions forced by CRT tiers.


Design Patterns for Combining Layers
   1. Ternary-first, binary micro.

                                  W = S33  S22 ·A2727 A9 9 A3 3 A4𝛼4 A2𝛼2 .

                                           spine   micro


      Place W2(0 1) after S2 for off-beat lift.
   2. Binary-first syncopation.

                                  W ′ = S22 W2(0 1) S33 · A4𝛼4 A2𝛼2 A2727 A9 9 A3 3 .
                                                                        𝛽      𝛽   𝛽



      Noncommutation changes feel without changing factors.
   3. Quinary color without collisions.

                                        W5 = W · X¬3 A5 5 W5(0 2 4 1 3) .
                                                              𝛾



      Small 𝛾5 and separate channel 𝑒 𝑐 preserve energy and clarity.
   4. Heptadic drift over a CRT scaffold.

                            W7 = W · A7♭,𝛿 (optionally update 𝜇 ↦→ 𝜇 + 𝜌).

      Choose 𝛿 ≪ 𝛼2 , 𝛽3 to keep drift perceptual but not dominant.
   5. Projector-aligned layering. Use level projectors to keep roles separated:

                       micro: (𝐼 − Π3 ) A2 ,        spine: Π3 A9 ,          cadence: Π27 A27 .

      Ensures micro never overwrites phrase boundaries.
Default weights. Recommended ordering 𝛽27 > 𝛽9 > 𝛽3 > 𝛼4 > 𝛼2 > 𝛾5 > 𝛿 for clear
hierarchy.

State and Relation Actions; Joint Operators
Let M = (X𝑛 , 𝐻) with X𝑛 = {𝑥 : T𝑛 → R𝑘 } and 𝐻 = (𝑉, 𝐸, 𝜄). We write tick–channel arrays as
𝑋 ∈ R𝑛×𝑘 with 𝑋 [𝑡] = 𝑥(𝑡). Incidence is 𝐵 ∈ {0, 1} |𝑉 |×|𝐸 | with 𝐵𝑣𝑒 = 1 iff 𝑣 ∈ 𝜄(𝑒). Vertex/edge
states are 𝜎 ∈ R|𝑉 |×𝑘 𝑉 , 𝜏 ∈ R|𝐸 |×𝑘 𝐸 .

State operators.      For prime 𝑝 and level 𝑟 ≥ 1:
                                                                                                         

with 𝑢 ∈ {0, . . . , 𝑝 − 1} and 𝜋 ∈ 𝑆 𝑝 .

Relation operators. 𝑄ˆ 𝑝 acts on (𝐵, 𝜎, 𝜏) by split/merge/fold/relabel:

               split
            𝑄ˆ 𝑝 : 𝑒 ↦→ {𝑒 (𝑢) }𝑢=0 , 𝐵′ = 𝐵 on each 𝑒 (𝑢) , 𝜏(𝑒 (𝑢) ) = Refine 𝑝 (𝜏(𝑒), 𝑢),

and analogously for merge (inverse), fold (quotient by 𝑝-cycle), relabel (apply (𝜙𝑉 , 𝜙 𝐸 ) ∈
Aut(𝐻)).

Joint operator.     A prime-indexed joint action is the pair

                                      b( 𝑝) = W𝜋𝑝 R𝜙𝑟 A𝛼𝑝𝑟 S 𝑝𝑟 ; 𝑄ˆ 𝑝 ,

Accent (additive comb).         Let 𝐷 𝑝𝑟 [𝑡] = [ 𝑝𝑟 | 𝑡]. Then

                                                𝑝

so A𝛼𝑝𝑟 injects a spectral comb on multiples of 𝑛/𝑝𝑟 in the accent channel.

Multiplicative gate.     Δ 𝑝𝑟 𝑥 = [ 𝑝𝑟 | 𝑡] · 𝑥(𝑡) gives

                                            𝑝𝑟 𝑋 = 𝑋   d 𝑝𝑟 ,


i.e., convolution with the comb selects and spreads energy across those harmonics.

Subdivision S 𝑝 (zero-order hold upsample).              For 𝑌 = S 𝑝 𝑋 of length 𝑝𝑛,

                         𝑢=0

where 𝐷 𝑝 is the Dirichlet kernel. Interpretation: spectrum replication to 𝑝𝑛 with comb-shaped
envelope.

Permutation W𝜋𝑝 .      Acts as a block mixing on frequency cosets 𝑘 ≡ 𝑟 (mod 𝑝):

                                 𝑌b[𝑘] = 𝑈𝜋 (𝑟) 𝑋
                                                b[𝑘],       𝑟 = 𝑘 mod 𝑝,

with 𝑈𝜋 (𝑟) a 𝑝 × 𝑝 unitary determined by 𝜋 and 𝑟. Thus W𝜋𝑝 redistributes energy within
𝑝-families of harmonics.


Gauge Equivalence and Identifiability
Let 𝐺 be a gauge group acting on M by (𝑔 · 𝑋, 𝑔 · 𝐻) with 𝑔 = (𝑔𝑡 , 𝑔𝑉 , 𝑔 𝐸 ) combining time
rephasing, vertex, and edge relabeling. A resonance 𝑅(W [M]; 𝐷) is gauge-invariant if

                       𝑅(W [M]; 𝐷) = 𝑅 (𝑔 W 𝑔 −1 ) [M]; 𝐷 ,
                                                         
                                                                          ∀𝑔 ∈ 𝐺.

Hence operator words are identifiable only up to 𝐺-conjugacy and phase:

                  W ∼ W′                     ∃𝑔 ∈ 𝐺, 𝜙 ∈ Z : W ′ = R𝑛 𝑔 W 𝑔 −1 .

Sutra-Style Rewrite Interpretation
Let A be an alphabet of tick-classes (e.g., {◦, •, □, ♢} for micro, beat, phrase, cadence) and let
words 𝑤 ∈ A ∗ encode sequences along T𝑛 . Operators act as local rewrites:

          S1 (Subdivision) 𝑋 ⇒ 𝑋0 𝑋1 · · · 𝑋 𝑝−1 (replace a symbol by 𝑝 children)
          S2 (Permutation) 𝑋0 · · · 𝑋 𝑝−1 ⇒ 𝑋𝜋(0) · · · 𝑋𝜋( 𝑝−1)
          S3 (Accent)      𝑋 ⇒ 𝑋 ↑ if position 𝑡 ≡ 0 (mod 𝑝𝑟 )
          S4 (Rotation)    𝑢 0 𝑢 1 · · · 𝑢 𝑛−1 ⇒ 𝑢 𝜏 𝑢 𝜏+1 · · · 𝑢 𝜏+𝑛−1
          S5 (Split/Merge) 𝑒 ⇒ 𝑒 (0) · · · 𝑒 ( 𝑝−1) and inverse if coherent

    These sutras are compositional: a prime word is a short rewrite program. Resonance validates
a program by comparing its generated word (or its numeric lift 𝑋) to data 𝐷. Minimal programs
under a canonical gauge are preferred; ablations (operator removal or order swaps) quantify
necessity.
Practical note. In implementation, keep both domains: time-space operators for construction
and the spectral view for diagnostics. Use projectors Π 𝑝𝑟 to audit tier energies, and use comb
masks to detect unintended cross-prime interference introduced by W𝜋𝑝 or relation folds.

Aggregation
Choose 𝜆 1 , 𝜆2 , 𝜆3 ≥ 0 with 𝜆1 + 𝜆 2 + 𝜆 3 = 1. The resonance score is

                 𝑅(𝑥, 𝐷) = 𝜆 1 𝑅1 (𝑥, 𝐷) + 𝜆2 𝑅2 (𝑥, 𝐷) + 𝜆3 𝑅3 (𝑥, 𝐷) ∈ [0, 1].

Default emphasis for clear tiered rhythm: 𝜆1 = 0.4, 𝜆 2 = 0.35, 𝜆 3 = 0.25.


Norms, Windowing, and Clipping
    • Norms. 𝑅1 uses ℓ2 by default; for sparse spiky patterns use ℓ1 or Huber loss in the
      numerator/denominator to reduce outlier dominance.
    • Windowing. Taper 𝑤 [𝑡] reduces spectral leakage in 𝑅1 and improves alignment robustness.
      Use the same 𝑤 when computing b      b for 𝑅2 , 𝑅3 if leakage is severe.
                                        𝑥, 𝐷
    • Clipping. Soft-clip amplitudes before scoring: 𝑠 𝜅 (𝑎) = 𝜅 tanh(𝑎/𝜅) with knee 𝜅 > 0 to
      prevent a few large events from saturating 𝑅1 and 𝑅2 .


“Proof by Resonance” Workflow
                                                        Î
   1. Specify scaffold. Fix 𝑛 and its factorization 𝑛 = 𝑝𝑟 𝑝 . Choose tiers D, weights 𝜂 𝑑 , and
      aggregation 𝜆.
   2. Initialize word. Construct 𝑁b from prime words 𝑃ˆ ( 𝑝) with initial parameters (subdivision
      depth, accent weights, rotations, permutations).
   3. Optimize. Maximize 𝑅(𝑥, 𝐷) over discrete orderings and rotations, and over continuous
      accent weights. Use grid search for 𝜙 and 𝜋, coordinate ascent or derivative-free optimizers
      for amplitudes.


                                                           15
   4. Gauge-fix. Pin downbeats and apply canonical relabeling to remove trivial symmetries.
      Recompute 𝑅 post-gauge.
   5. Ablate. Remove or reorder single operators; record Δ𝑅 to identify necessity and sufficiency
      of each layer.
   6. Validate. Test on held-out windows or transpositions (𝑇𝜏 𝐷) and report (𝑅1 , 𝑅2 , 𝑅3 ) with
      tier breakdown.


Benchmarks: Synthetic and Real Cycles
Synthetic.
   • 108-cycle. Ground-truth S33 S22 with accents at 27, 9, 3, 4, 2; add jitter, missing hits, and
     colored noise. Report 𝑅 vs. SNR and jitter.
   • Co-prime overlays. 𝑛 ∈ {60, 84, 90} with known prime layers; test recovery under wrong
     operator order to show noncommutation effects on 𝑅.
   • Heptadic drift. Overlay 𝑝 = 7 ornaments on scaffolds with 7 ∤ 𝑛; verify 𝑅3 sensitivity to
     slow phase drift.

Real.
    • Metered sequences. Annotated rhythmic patterns with binary–ternary interlocks; assess
      tier energies and lock.
    • Breath or gait cycles. Windowed counts mapped to T𝑛 ; evaluate whether observed
      periodicities align with prime tiers via 𝑅2 and phase coherence via 𝑅3 .
    • Counting rituals. Sequences with target counts (e.g., 108) to validate cadence placement
      and robustness to omissions.
Reporting. For each dataset: (𝑅1 , 𝑅2 , 𝑅3 ), tier-wise {𝐸 𝑥 (𝐾 𝑑 ), 𝐸 𝐷 (𝐾 𝑑 )}, phase polar plots per
𝑑, and ablation table of operator contributions to 𝑅.

   2. Congruences. Test 𝑎 𝑛+𝑚 ≡ 𝑎 𝑛 (mod 𝑝 𝑗 ) when R 𝑝 𝑗 enforces periodic phase; match to

   3. Cycle fits. Map 𝑎 𝑛 windows to T𝑛 and evaluate (𝑅1 , 𝑅2 , 𝑅3 ) against 𝑁-generated

Analysis: cadence, syncopation, resonance.
    • Cadence structure. W△ yields predictable peaks at 𝐶0 with subordinate tiers 𝐶1 , 𝐶2 ;
      binary layers 𝐶3 , 𝐶4 fill interstices.
    • Syncopation. W□ places W2 before ternary gating, shifting micro energy off the ternary
      spine; compare by 𝑅1 after optimal rotation.
    • Resonance scores. Evaluate (𝑅1 , 𝑅2 , 𝑅3 ) against annotated targets. Expect 𝑅2 to favor
      W△ (better tier energy at 27, 9, 3), while 𝑅1 may favor W□ on datasets with intended
      backbeat emphasis. Phase coherence 𝑅3 discriminates heptadic drift layers when present.

Algorithms and Implementation

Data Structures
Time lattice. T𝑛 = {0, . . . , 𝑛 − 1}. Store patterns as dense arrays 𝑋 ∈ R𝑛×𝑘 with row-major
layout. Provide circular indexing helpers and FFT backends for C𝑛×𝑘 .

Hypergraph incidence. 𝐻 = (𝑉, 𝐸, 𝜄) with |𝑉 | = 𝑁𝑉 , |𝐸 | = 𝑁 𝐸 . Use:
   • CSR-like incidence: arrays edge_ptr[0..𝑁 𝐸 ] and edge_vtx[0..|𝜄|-1].

                                                    19
    • Vertex and edge state tensors: 𝜎 ∈ R𝑁𝑉 ×𝑘 𝑉 , 𝜏 ∈ R𝑁 𝐸 ×𝑘 𝐸 .

Operator pipeline.     Represent an operator word as an ordered list of typed nodes:

Each node stores in-place and out-of-place kernels. Provide two evaluation modes:
  1. eager: apply kernels sequentially on 𝑋, (𝜎, 𝜏).
  2. jit-graph: fuse linear parts; push FFT-based rotations to frequency domain.

Parameterization Θ = {𝛼, 𝜙, 𝜋, 𝑄}
    • Accents 𝛼 = {𝛼 𝑝 𝑗 } per prime-tier and channel.
    • Rotations 𝜙 = {𝜙 𝑝 𝑗 }. Use fractional 𝜏 = 𝜙 𝑛/𝑝 𝑗 ∈ R realized via phase in Fourier domain
      for differentiability.
    • Permutations 𝜋 = {𝜋 𝑝 ∈ 𝑆 𝑝 } per prime. Discrete; optimized by search.
    • Relation ops 𝑄ˆ = {𝜃 𝑄 }: split/merge/fold/relabel parameters (discrete topology moves
      with optional continuous weights for merge criteria).
Optional hyperparameters: projector weights 𝜂 𝑑 , score weights 𝜆 = (𝜆 1 , 𝜆2 , 𝜆3 ), ornament gains

    • Accents. For additive accents 𝑋 ′ = 𝑋 + 𝛼                 ⊤ 𝜕𝐿 =               , 𝐷 𝑝 𝑗 𝑒⊤

    • Rotations. Use fractional shift via phase:

     Backprop through FFT to obtain 𝜕𝐿/𝜕𝜏, then map to 𝜕𝐿/𝜕𝜙.
To avoid arg non-differentiability in 𝑅3 , use atan2 with small 𝜖 or adopt a cosine surrogate
cos(Δ𝜑).

Discrete structure (for 𝜋, 𝑄,ˆ and order).
   • Beam search over operator orderings and 𝜋, score by 𝑅. Beam width 𝐵 ∈ [8, 64] suffices
     for 𝑝 ∈ {2, 3, 5, 7}.
   • Local moves: swap adjacent operators, toggle W 𝑝 placement, increment 𝜙 by grid steps,
     flip accent tiers on/off.

                                                   20
    • Evolutionary loop: population of words; mutation = local moves; crossover = splice at
      prime boundaries; selection by 𝑅.
    • Relation search 𝑄:
                       ˆ greedy split/merge with acceptance if Δ𝑅 > 0; periodic fold/relabel
      proposals. Optionally MCMC with temperature schedule.

Soft relaxations (optional). Gumbel-Sinkhorn for 𝜋 as doubly-stochastic 𝑃 with annealing;
project to nearest permutation at evaluation time. Straight-through estimators for discrete toggles.


Complexity and Memory
Let 𝐿 be operator count, 𝑘 channels, 𝑛 ticks, 𝑑max = max 𝑝 arity.
    • S 𝑝 : 𝑂 (𝑛) write; increases length to 𝑝𝑛 if materialized. Prefer virtual indexing; cost 𝑂 (1)
      per access.
    • A 𝑝 𝑗 : 𝑂 (𝑛).
    • R 𝑝 𝑗 : time-domain shift 𝑂 (𝑛); FFT method 𝑂 (𝑛 log 𝑛) but batches and composes well;
      preferred when learning 𝜙.
    • W 𝑝 : 𝑂 (𝑛) with stride-𝑝 block shuffles; cache-friendly.
    • FFTs: 𝑂 (𝑛 log 𝑛) per channel; reuse plans; fuse multiple spectral ops in one for-
      ward–backward pass.
    • Relation 𝑄ˆ 𝑝 : split/merge linear in |𝜄|; fold/relabel linear in |𝑉 | + |𝐸 | + |𝜄|.
Memory: 𝑂 (𝑛𝑘) for 𝑋 plus 𝑂 (|𝑉 | + |𝐸 | + |𝜄|). During backprop with FFT, peak memory 𝑂 (𝑛𝑘)
activations per fused block. Use gradient checkpointing over operator groups to cap peak RAM.

Numerical stability.
  • Normalize 𝑋 per channel before scoring; soft-clip with 𝑠 𝜅 .
  • Use real-to-complex FFTs; maintain Hermitian symmetry if signals are real.
  • For S 𝑝 , prefer lazy indexing to avoid exploding 𝑛.


Reproducibility
    • Seeds. Fix RNG seeds for: parameter init, beam tie-breaking, mutation proposals. Record
      in metadata.
    • Configs. YAML/JSON config with 𝑛, factorization tiers, 𝜆, 𝜂, learning rates, optimizer,
      beam width, move set, early-stopping thresholds, and gauge-fix rules.
    • Determinism. Turn off nondeterministic kernels; use deterministic FFT/plans; fix thread
      counts. Prefer integer rotations via FFT phase over time-domain circular shifts for exact
      reproducibility.
    • Paths. Cache exact operator words and parameters at each checkpoint; store hashes of
      datasets; version 𝑁
                        b as a string of tokens.
    • Ablation sheets. Export per-operator Δ𝑅, tier energies, and phase polar plots; include
      commit hashes and environment manifest.
With these structures and procedures, MOC training scales as 𝑂 (𝑇 · (𝑛 log 𝑛 + |𝜄|)) in typical
FFT-backed implementations, with bounded memory via operator fusion and checkpointing, and
with deterministic replay from saved words, seeds, and configs.


Experiments

Datasets
We evaluate MOC on three domains with tiered periodic structure.

Metrical corpora. Annotated rhythmic sequences with binary–ternary interlocks; each item
provides onsets, bar boundaries, and meter labels. Sequences are mapped to lattices T𝑛 with
𝑛 ∈ {48, 60, 72, 84, 90, 96, 108}.


                                              22
Ritual schedules. Counted-cycle practices (e.g., 108 recitations) with annotated cadence
points and optional ornament layers. Instances include fixed-𝑛 sessions and multi-session logs
with interruptions.

Physiological cycles. Breath or gait signals segmented to windows; per-window lattice sizes
chosen by period estimates (median-IQR of inter-event intervals) and snapped to the nearest
highly composite 𝑛.


Protocols
    • Splits. For corpora with ≥ 100 items: 70% train, 15% validation, 15% test; stratified by
      nominal meter and 𝑛. For smaller sets: 5-fold cross-validation. Random seeds fixed and
      reported.
    • Training. Optimize continuous parameters 𝛼, 𝜙 by gradient steps on 𝑅; search discrete
      𝜋, 𝑄ˆ by beam width 𝐵 ∈ {16, 32} with early stop on validation 𝑅.
    • Gauge-fixing. Downbeat pinning on top tier, canonical relabeling for (𝑉, 𝐸), CRT phase
      normal form before scoring.
    • Baselines. (i) Uniform accent grid; (ii) HMM with periodic states; (iii) Spectral-comb
      matcher without noncommutative ordering.


Ablations
   1. Remove single primes. Drop all 𝑝-family operators for 𝑝 ∈ {2, 3, 5, 7}; reoptimize
      remaining parameters.
   2. Vary order. Enumerate adjacent swaps in the operator word; record Δ𝑅.
   3. Freeze relations. Disallow 𝑄ˆ on 𝐻 (state-only) versus full joint action.
   4. Disable projectors. Remove Π 𝑝𝑟 from diagnostics to test reliance on CRT structure.


Metrics
Primary scores are the resonance components:

𝑅1 (time correlation),   𝑅2 (harmonic lock),   𝑅3 (phase coherence),   𝑅 = 𝜆1 𝑅1 +𝜆2 𝑅2 +𝜆3 𝑅3 .

We also report:
    • Confusion among gauge-equivalent words. Let C be conjugacy classes under gauge;
      top-1 class accuracy 𝐴class = 𝑁1 𝑖 1{ 𝑁
                                      Í      b𝑖 ∈ C(𝑁 ★)}.

    • Tier energies. 𝐸 𝑝𝑟 via projectors Π 𝑝𝑟 and their KL divergence from targets.
    • Order sensitivity. Δ𝑅 distribution across single adjacent swaps.
Error bars are mean±sd over seeds and 95% bootstrap CIs (1,000 resamples).

Sensitivity to Noise and Tempo Drift
Noise. Additive noise: 𝑥 ′ = 𝑥 + 𝜀, 𝜀 ∼ N (0, 𝜎 2 𝐼). Deletion noise: drop each event with prob.
𝑝 miss . Jitter: shift onsets by Δ𝑡 ∼ N (0, 𝜎𝑡2 ). We sweep SNR ∈ {5, 10, 20} dB, 𝑝 miss ∈ [0, 0.3],
and 𝜎𝑡 up to one micro-tick.

Tempo drift.    Time-warp via multiplicative random walk on phase:
                            ∑︁
                 𝑡′ = 𝑡 +         𝜉𝑢 ,   𝜉𝑢 ∼ N (0, 𝜎𝜙2 ),   or   𝜙¤𝑢+1 = 𝜌 𝜙¤𝑢 + 𝜂𝑢 ,
                            𝑢≤𝑡

then resample to T𝑛 . Report 𝑅 vs. 𝜎𝜙 and AR coefficient 𝜌.

Discussion of Outcomes
MOC outperforms baselines on all datasets in 𝑅2 and 𝑅3 , confirming harmonic tier lock and
phase coherence. On physio data with nonstationary tempo, binary-first words sometimes yield
higher 𝑅1 , reflecting backbeat-like emphasis. Ablations verify necessity of 𝑝 = 3 for phrase-level
structure and 𝑝 = 2 for micro-timing; primes 5, 7 contribute stability under drift without large 𝑅
gains, acting as informative priors rather than core scaffolds.
   All code produces tables (.csv) and figures (.pdf) with fixed seeds and configuration
manifests to enable deterministic reproduction of the numbers reported in Table 1 and Figures 1–
3.


Applications

Rhythm Design and Computational Music
Goal. Author meters and grooves from prime layers rather than bar templates.

Method. Choose 𝑛, build 𝑁                 𝑝𝑃      , render 𝑥 : T𝑛 → R𝑘 , export to MIDI or OSC.

                   𝑝 𝑟 ∥𝑛


Use cases. (i) meter families by factor set (e.g., 𝑛 ∈ {48, 60, 72, 108}); (ii) controlled syncopation
via W2 placement; (iii) ornament channels from 𝑝 ∈ {5, 7} avoiding ternary collisions with
projector gates.
Recipe:
  1. Pick factorization tiers; set weights 𝛽27 > 𝛽9 > 𝛽3 > 𝛼4 > 𝛼2 .
  2. Select order (ternary-first vs binary-first); audition 𝑅1 against a guide track.
  3. Freeze Π27 peaks; sweep 𝜙 for lock; export stems per prime channel.


Breath and Practice Timers with Nested Periodicities
Goal. Timers that align micro inhalation/exhalation ticks to macro counts (e.g., 108 recitations).
Method. Lattice 𝑛 = 108; set macro accents at 27, 9, 3 and micro prompts at 4, 2. Adaptive drift
correction:
                                                                      

recentering the timer to the user’s phase. Use low-salience haptics on 𝑏 2 , 𝑏 4 ; high-salience on
𝑎 27 , 𝑎 9 .


Patterned Scheduling and UI Haptics
Goal. Non-intrusive notifications and micro-interactions with prime-gated spacing.
Method. Assign each notification class 𝑐 a prime 𝑝 𝑐 and tier 𝑝𝑟𝑐𝑐 . Schedule at ticks 𝑡 with
[ 𝑝𝑟𝑐𝑐 | 𝑡] = 1, optionally anti-coinciding with a protected tier 𝑞 𝑠 using (1 − [𝑞 𝑠 | 𝑡]) gates. Haptic
envelope per tier: short/soft for micro (2, 4), longer/firm for macro (9, 27).
Collision policy. Priority by tier weight; resolve ties via W 𝑝 permutations for fair interleave.
Fairness invariant 𝐹 [𝜎] ↑ prevents starvation.


Linguistic Sandhi-as-Operator Analogies
Goal. Map phonological coalescence and assimilation to prime-indexed rewrites.
Model. Let tokens be vertices; syllabic or morpheme relations be hyperedges.

            split

Resonance 𝑅2 measures fit to metrical feet; 𝑅3 checks phase-coherent sandhi across repeated
frames. Operator order distinguishes pre- versus post-lexical sandhi.


Educational Tools for Factorization-as-Form
Goal. Teach prime factorization as audible/visible structure.
Widgets.
    • Tier dialer. Toggle 𝑝𝑟 to hear/see its layer; show Π 𝑝𝑟 energy bar.
    • Order flipper. Swap operators and A/B the result; display Δ𝑅.
    • CRT canvas. Side-by-side Z/4 and Z/27 grids with synchronized cursors.
Assessment. Tasks: “design a cadence with 𝐶0 , 𝐶1 , 𝐶2 only,” or “add 𝑝 = 5 ornament avoiding
ternary collisions.” Score via 𝑅 and invariants.


Domain Map (Primes as Semantics)
              Prime   Role                          Typical constraint

These application patterns use the same core machinery: prime families for structure, noncom-
mutative ordering for feel, projectors for separation, and resonance for validation. Outputs are
reproducible, parameter-light, and directly exportable to audio, haptics, or symbolic sequences.


Comparison to Related Work

Western Metrical Models and Polyrhythm Frameworks
Classical metrical theories model rhythm via hierarchical grids and accent preference rules;
polyrhythms are often expressed as superposed integer ratios on a fixed meter. Euclidean and
cyclic constructions generate evenly spaced onsets by modular spacing. These approaches
typically assume: (i) object-first scoring of events with meter as context; (ii) commutative
superposition of layers; and (iii) evaluation by likelihood or rule satisfaction. Difference. MOC
places prime-indexed operators at the foundation, treats layer interaction as noncommutative, and
validates with a multi-view resonance functional rather than local preference or likelihood alone.


Graph Signal Processing and Hypergraph Dynamics
Graph signal processing (GSP) filters vertex signals using Laplacians and Fourier bases;
extensions to hypergraphs define higher-order Laplacians and diffusion. These methods prioritize

                                               28
linear, spectral operators on fixed topology. Difference. MOC acts on both signals and
relations: Pb( 𝑝) = ( S 𝑝 , A 𝑝𝑟 , R 𝑝𝑟 , W 𝑝 ; 𝑄ˆ 𝑝 ) couples state transforms with topological moves
(split/merge/fold/relabel). The CRT projectors Π 𝑝𝑟 provide tiered diagnostics incompatible with
a single Laplacian spectrum when operator order reshapes incidence.


Rule-Based Generative Systems and Rewrite Calculi
Generative grammars, L-systems, and term-rewrite calculi create structure by deterministic or
stochastic rules. They offer compositionality and minimal programs but commonly assume
syntactic equivalence modulo confluence or Church–Rosser properties. Difference. MOC’s
“sutra” rules are prime-tiered and intentionally order-sensitive; noncommutation is a feature, not
a defect. Equivalence is judged up to gauge and resonance, not solely by derivational normal
forms.


Modular Forms and 𝑞-Series Analogies for Prime Gating
Euler products, Dirichlet characters, and Hecke operators exhibit prime-factor gating of coeffi-
cients; theta functions and modular forms encode arithmetic in 𝑞-expansions. These provide
deep arithmetic structure and symmetry under modular groups. Analogy. MOC’s coefficient
             Î
gates 𝑎 𝑛 = 𝑝 𝑔 𝑝 (𝑣 𝑝 (𝑛)) mirror prime-sensitive weighting, and rotations resemble phase twists
on coefficients. Caveat. MOC does not claim modularity; it leverages the idea of prime-tier
factorization to design operator words whose spectral combs align with arithmetic tiers, then
tests fit via resonance and congruence checks.


Distinctives: Prime-Indexed Noncommutation and Resonance Proof
MOC differs along five axes:
   1. Prime-indexed families. Each prime 𝑝 supplies a bundled set ( S 𝑝 , A 𝑝𝑟 , R 𝑝𝑟 , W 𝑝 ; 𝑄ˆ 𝑝 )
      across tiers 𝑝𝑟 .
   2. Explicit noncommutation. Operator order changes outcomes (feel, cadence, lock); this is
      central, not noise.
   3. Joint state–relation action. Relation operators 𝑄ˆ 𝑝 alter incidence, enabling dynamics
      beyond fixed-topology filtering.
   4. CRT-tier diagnostics. Projectors Π 𝑝𝑟 separate macro/meso/micro content and guide
      design and validation.
   5. Proof by resonance. Validity is empirical-formal: 𝑅 = 𝜆 1 𝑅1 + 𝜆2 𝑅2 + 𝜆3 𝑅3 ∈ [0, 1]
      combines time correlation, harmonic lock, and phase coherence. “Proof” means achieving
      stable, reproducible high 𝑅 under ablations and gauge normalization.
In short, MOC integrates arithmetic tiering, noncommutative operator composition, and joint
topology–signal action, and it assesses adequacy through a calibrated resonance score rather

Ethics and Constraints

Cultural Context and Non-Appropriative Framing
This work draws conceptual inspiration from Eastern traditions that treat number and relation as
co-arising. We do not claim historical identity with specific ritual, musical, or philosophical
systems. The Multiplicity Operator Calculus (MOC) is a modern formalism. Appropriate use
includes:
    • citing cultural sources when reproducing patterns associated with living traditions,
    • obtaining consent for data derived from ritual or personal practice,
    • offering opt-out and anonymization for shared materials,
    • avoiding commercial packaging that implies endorsement by source communities.
When releasing datasets, include provenance statements, community permissions (where
applicable), and context notes to prevent decontextualized reuse.


Interpretability vs. Automation Tradeoffs
MOC can be fully automated (search over operator words), but we recommend interpretability-first
practice:
   1. Word transparency. Publish the exact operator word, parameter vector Θ = {𝛼, 𝜙, 𝜋, 𝑄}, ˆ
      and gauge-fix applied.
   2. Ablation logs. Release per-operator Δ𝑅 and order-swap effects to show which layers are
      decisive.
   3. Tier diagnostics. Report CRT-tier energies 𝐸 𝑝𝑟 and phase polar plots for reproducibility
      and audit.
   4. Human-in-the-loop. For cultural or pedagogical settings, prefer curator-approved operator
      orders over black-box search.
Automation without these disclosures risks inscrutability and the projection of false authority
onto generated structures.

and a fairness measure over carriers (e.g., tasks, users, channels) indexed by 𝑖:

                                           min𝑖 Σ𝑖           ∑︁
                                 𝐹 [𝜎] =           with Σ𝑖 =    𝜎𝑖 (𝑡),
                                           max𝑖 Σ𝑖            𝑡

subject to 𝐹 [𝜎] ≥ 𝐹min . Admissible operator words satisfy these inequalities by construction or
by projection:
                                                            
                                  W ↦→ Proj{𝐸,𝐸 𝑝𝑟 ,𝐹} W ,

ensuring energy budgets and fair allocation persist across noncommutative compositions.


Scope Limits: Where MOC Does Not Apply
    • Non-cyclic or aperiodic dynamics. MOC assumes a finite lattice T𝑛 and CRT tiers; it
      is not suited to strongly aperiodic or continuous-time chaotic systems without explicit
      discretization and validation.
    • Prime-agnostic phenomena. Domains where factorization does not meaningfully encode
      structure (e.g., arbitrary real-valued spectra without salient combs) are out of scope.
    • Causal inference. Resonance 𝑅 establishes descriptive fit, not causation. Do not treat
      high 𝑅 as evidence of mechanism.
    • Clinical or safety-critical use. Breath/gait examples are illustrative. MOC is not a
      diagnostic or therapeutic device; do not use without domain-specific validation and
      oversight.
    • Doctrinal claims. The calculus does not validate metaphysical or religious assertions. It
      models patterns; interpretation remains human and context-dependent.


Operational Guardrails
Before deployment:
  1. set (𝐸 max , 𝜂max
                   𝑝 𝑟 , 𝐹min ) and enforce them at compile time of the operator word,
  2. log seeds, configs, gauge choices, and ablations,
  3. include a cultural-context note with provenance and usage constraints,
  4. provide a user control to disable ornaments (𝑝 = 5, 7) and to reduce micro density (𝑝 = 2)
     for accessibility.


                                                      31
These measures preserve transparency, respect for sources, and user well-being while retaining
the expressive power of prime-indexed, noncommutative design.


Limitations

Identifiability Under Gauge Classes
MOC operator words are identifiable only up to gauge and phase:

                    W ∼ W ′ ⇐⇒ ∃ 𝑔 ∈ 𝐺, 𝜙 ∈ Z : W ′ = R𝑛 𝑔 W 𝑔 −1 ,
                                                                  𝜙



with 𝐺 acting on time, vertices, and edges. In practice, nontrivial collisions occur: distinct
words produce indistinguishable outputs after gauge-fix and rotation, especially when weights
on lower tiers are small or when ornaments (𝑝 = 5, 7) are suppressed. Our diagnostics (tier
energies, phase polar plots) reduce but do not eliminate ambiguity. Hence point-estimates of
operator order should be reported as gauge classes rather than unique words.


Discrete Operator Relaxations and Gradient Fidelity
Learning uses continuous relaxations for discrete choices (permutations 𝜋, topology moves
 ˆ Doubly-stochastic relaxations (e.g., Gumbel–Sinkhorn) and straight-through estimators
𝑄).
introduce bias:
                                         b ≠ ∇𝜋 E[ 𝑅],
                                   E[∇𝜋 𝑅]          b

and annealing schedules may “freeze” into suboptimal permutations whose test-time projection
degrades 𝑅. Similarly, surrogate losses for 𝑅3 avoid arg discontinuities but can flatten gradients
near phase lock. These issues limit convergence guarantees and complicate reproducibility when
discrete search spaces are large.


Handling Incommensurate Periods at Scale
MOC assumes a finite lattice T𝑛 . Real data often mixes near-coprime or drifting periods, pushing
𝑛 toward large lcm values. This increases memory and FFT cost, and it weakens CRT-tier
separation when some prime powers are absent or very large. Approximations—windowed
lattices, multi-rate tiling, rational approximants—help but introduce boundary artifacts and
leakage that affect 𝑅2 and 𝑅3 . Heptadic overlays on scaffolds with 7 ∤ 𝑛 are supported only as
sparse gates, not true tiers, limiting formal symmetry.




                                               32
Real-Time Constraints and Latency
Interactive uses (haptics, timers) require low latency. Rotation and spectral diagnostics favor FFT
methods with 𝑂 (𝑛 log 𝑛) cost and batch latency, conflicting with real-time feedback. Sliding
updates for the DFT mitigate but still incur per-harmonic maintenance:
                                                                    
                            b𝑡+1 [𝑘] = 𝜔−𝑘
                            𝑋           𝑛    𝑋
                                             b𝑡 [𝑘] + 𝑥 𝑡+1 − 𝑥 𝑡+1−𝑛 ,


which is 𝑂 (𝑛) per tick without subsampling. Phase-locked loop corrections improve alignment
but add smoothing delay. In practice we must trade fidelity for responsiveness by (i) limiting
active tiers, (ii) precompiling operator words, and (iii) scoring on downsampled combs. These
choices can under-estimate syncopation effects and reduce sensitivity to weak tiers.


Additional Practical Limits
     • Energy/fairness constraints. Hard caps on tier energies or fairness may render optimiza-
       tion infeasible; projection steps can distort noncommutative order effects.
     • Topology dynamics. Relation operators 𝑄ˆ that change incidence complicate caching
       and invalidate linear-time assumptions; current implementations restrict the frequency of
       topology moves.
     • Noise models. The resonance functional presumes stationary noise within windows;
       heavy-tailed or bursty noise patterns bias 𝑅1 and 𝑅2 unless robust norms are used.
Overall, MOC is most reliable on moderate 𝑛 with clear prime tiers, limited discrete search, and
offline scoring. Streaming, highly incommensurate, or topology-heavy regimes expose the above
limitations.


Future Work

Continuous-Time Extensions and Adelic Formulations
Continuous time. Replace the lattice T𝑛 by the circle group T = R/𝑇Z with signals in 𝐿 2 (T, R𝑘 )
or tempered distributions. Prime tiers become semigroups of flows

                                     S𝑝 (𝜏) = 𝑒 𝜏L 𝑝 ,   𝜏 ≥ 0,

where L 𝑝 generates 𝑝-rate refinement/rotation; discrete S 𝑝 , R 𝑝𝑟 arise by sampling 𝜏 on rational
grids. Comb masks generalize to Dirac combs 𝑝𝑟 ; projectors Π 𝑝𝑟 become convolution with
low-pass kernels supported on harmonics {𝑘 𝑇/𝑝𝑟 }.




                                                 33
   Adeles. Model multi-tier time as the restricted product

Learning Relation Operators 𝑄ˆ 𝑝 from Data
Objective. Jointly infer topology moves and state operators by maximizing 𝑅 with regularizers
on incidence complexity:

                                      b ˆ [M], 𝐷) − 𝜆 topo ∥𝜄′ ∥ 0 .
                               max 𝑅( 𝑁
                               ˆ Θ      Θ,𝑄
                               𝑄,


Approaches.
    • Structural EM: E-step proposes split/merge/fold candidates; M-step optimizes Θ =
      {𝛼, 𝜙, 𝜋}.
    • Policy search: reinforcement signal 𝑅 guides a topology policy over {split, merge, fold, relabel}
      with acceptance tests on invariants.
    • Differentiable proxies: soft-incidence tensors with entropic penalties; anneal to discrete 𝜄.
Validation. Report topology edit distance, invariant preservation, and ablation Δ𝑅 per relation
move.


Multi-Channel Vector Signals and Cross-Modal Coupling
Generalize 𝑥 : T𝑛 → R𝑘 with coupling operators

                            C 𝑝𝑟 : 𝑥 ↦→ 𝑀 𝑝𝑟 ∗ (Δ 𝑝𝑟 𝑥),         𝑀 𝑝𝑟 ∈ R𝑘×𝑘 ,

to route tier events across channels (audio, haptics, visual). Enforce energy/fairness invariants
                                             Í
per channel and cross-channel budgets (e.g., 𝑐 𝐸 𝑐 ≤ 𝐸 max , 𝐹 [𝜎] ≥ 𝐹min ). Extend resonance to
a weighted sum across modalities with modality weights 𝜔𝑐 and cross-coherence terms between
channels.


Formal Category-Theoretic Semantics
Define a category Mult:
    • Objects: multiplicity spaces M = (X, 𝐻) with designated CRT tiers.


                                                 34
    • Morphisms: gauge classes of operator words [W] : M → M ′ that preserve declared
       invariants.
    • Monoidal product: ⊗ via CRT (coprime concatenation of tiers) yielding M ⊗ M ′.
Projectors Π 𝑝𝑟 are natural transformations; resonance 𝑅 is a functor Mult → [0, 1] stable under
gauge. A 2-categorical layer can encode conjugation-by-gauge as 2-morphisms, clarifying
identifiability and equivalence.


Tooling: Editor, Sequencer, Resonance Meter
Editor. Visual CRT canvas with tier toggles, operator graph view, gauge-fix controls, and
invariant dashboards.
    Sequencer. Prime-lane DAW: lanes for 𝑝 ∈ {2, 3, 5, 7}, drag–drop S, A, R, W, 𝑄ˆ blocks,
real-time audition, export to MIDI/OSC/haptics.
    Resonance meter. Live (𝑅1 , 𝑅2 , 𝑅3 ) with tier energy bars, phase polar plots, and ablation
assistant that proposes minimal edits to raise 𝑅 while respecting budgets.
    Reproducibility. Project files store operator words, Θ, seeds, and gauge settings; one-click
“freeze” produces deterministic renders and reports.
These trajectories extend MOC from discrete lattices to continuous and adelic settings, from
fixed to learned relations, and from single-channel rhythms to cross-modal structures, while
giving a categorical backbone and practical tools for design, analysis, and deployment.


Conclusion

Contributions and Findings
We presented the Multiplicity Operator Calculus (MOC), a prime-indexed, noncommutative
framework acting jointly on signals and relations. The calculus supplies:
    • operator families ( S 𝑝 , A 𝑝𝑟 , R 𝑝𝑟 , W 𝑝 ; 𝑄ˆ 𝑝 ) with explicit cross-prime noncommutation;
    • CRT-tier projectors Π 𝑝𝑟 for analysis and control;
    • a resonance functional 𝑅 = 𝜆 1 𝑅1 +𝜆 2 𝑅2 +𝜆 3 𝑅3 ∈ [0, 1] that validates fit in time, spectrum,
      and phase;
    • a worked 𝑛 = 108 construction exposing the effect of operator order (ternary-first vs.
      binary-first);
    • algorithms for learning continuous parameters and searching discrete structure, with
      reproducibility and invariants.
Experiments on metrical, ritual, and physiological data show consistent gains in harmonic lock
and phase coherence over baselines, and ablations confirm the structural roles of 𝑝 = 3 (phrasing)
and 𝑝 = 2 (micro-timing), with 5, 7 as stable ornaments.



                                                 35
Practical Guidance for Adoption
   1. Choose 𝑛 by factorization. Prefer 𝑛 with meaningful prime powers; map data to T𝑛 via
      robust period estimates.
   2. Start with a scaffold. Build S𝑟3 then S2𝑠 for phrase-first timing; invert for syncopation.
   3. Gate and separate. Set a monotone accent hierarchy on {𝑝𝑟 }; keep roles distinct using
      Π 𝑝𝑟 .
   4. Tune by 𝑅. Optimize 𝛼 and 𝜙; search 𝜋 and word order with a small beam; always
      gauge-fix before reporting 𝑅.
   5. Respect budgets. Enforce energy and fairness invariants; use ornaments (5, 7) at low gain
      and anti-coincide with spine tiers as needed.
   6. Reproduce. Save seeds, configs, and the exact operator word; publish ablation deltas and
      tier diagnostics.


Open Problems and Next Steps
    • Theory. Continuous-time and adelic extensions; category-theoretic semantics; links to
      modular forms and Hecke-style actions.
    • Learning. Data-driven relation operators 𝑄ˆ 𝑝 ; better relaxations for permutations; struc-
      tured priors for operator order.
    • Identifiability. Sharper invariants for distinguishing gauge-equivalent words; confidence
      sets over classes.
    • Scalability. Multi-rate tilings for incommensurate periods; low-latency scoring for
      real-time feedback.
    • Multimodal. Vector signals with cross-channel coupling; resonance across audio, haptics,
      and visual strata.
    • Tooling and benchmarks. Open datasets with provenance, a prime-lane sequencer, and a
      standardized resonance meter.
MOC turns factorization into executable form: operators build structure, noncommutative order
shapes feel, and resonance supplies evidence. The framework is compact, interpretable, and
ready for controlled adoption in rhythm design, patterned scheduling, and pedagogy, with clear
pathways to deeper mathematics and broader applications.

Self-adjointness. With the standard inner product ⟨𝑥, 𝑦⟩ = 𝑡 𝑥(𝑡) ⊤ 𝑦(𝑡), rotations are unitary,
                                                               Í

so Π 𝑝𝑟 is self-adjoint as an average of unitaries. In frequency, it is a real diagonal mask.

Orthogonal decomposition (same prime).                             For 𝑎 ≤ 𝑏,

                   Π 𝑝𝑎 Π 𝑝𝑏 = Π 𝑝𝑏 ,              Π 𝑝 𝑎 − Π 𝑝 𝑏 projects onto {𝑘 : 𝑝 𝑎 | 𝑘, 𝑝 𝑏 ∤ 𝑘 }.

Mixed primes.            For coprime 𝑝 ≠ 𝑞,

                                                  Π 𝑝 𝑟 Π𝑞 𝑠 = Π𝑞 𝑠 Π 𝑝 𝑟 = Π 𝑝 𝑟 𝑞 𝑠 ,

since 1 𝑝𝑟 |𝑘 1𝑞 𝑠 |𝑘 = 1 𝑝𝑟 𝑞 𝑠 |𝑘 .


A.4 Commutation with Rotations
For any 𝜙 ∈ Z,

                                              𝑝𝑟 𝑢 𝑝
so range(Π 𝑝𝑟 ) is fixed-pointwise invariant under R 𝑝𝑟 .
    More generally, rotations commute as operators; hence Π 𝑝𝑟 commutes with any R𝑚 :

                                                        R𝑚 Π 𝑝 𝑟 = Π 𝑝 𝑟 R𝑚 ,

but only for 𝑚 = 𝑝𝑟 do we have Π 𝑝𝑟 R𝑚 = Π 𝑝𝑟 .

Special cases:

   • If 𝑝 ∤ 𝑞, then 𝑣 𝑝 (𝑞) = 0 and Π 𝑝𝑟 S𝑞 = S𝑞 Π 𝑝𝑟 .

     • If 𝑝𝑟 | 𝑞, then Π 𝑝𝑟 S𝑞 = S𝑞 (the refined lattice is already invariant at level 𝑝𝑟 ).


A.7 Permutations Inside Cells
Let W𝑞𝜋 permute the 𝑞 children within each parent cell: ( W𝑞𝜋 𝑥)(𝑞𝑡 + 𝑢) = 𝑥(𝑞𝑡 + 𝜋(𝑢)). In
frequency, W𝑞𝜋 mixes the 𝑞-tuple of coefficients in each residue class 𝑘 ≡ 𝑟 (mod 𝑞) by a unitary
𝑈𝜋 (𝑟) that depends on 𝑟 and 𝜋. Hence

Unless 𝑝𝑟 divides all ℎ in the residue class 𝑘 mod 𝑞 (rare), the two differ; thus [Π 𝑝𝑟 , W𝑞𝜋 ] ≠ 0 in
general.


A.8 Equivalent Characterizations
For 𝑝𝑟 | 𝑛, the following are equivalent for 𝑦 ∈ X𝑛 :
   1. Π 𝑝𝑟 𝑦 = 𝑦.
   2. R 𝑝𝑟 𝑦 = 𝑦.
      𝑦 [𝑘] = 0 unless 𝑝𝑟 | 𝑘.
   3. b
   4. 𝑦 factors through the CRT projection Z/𝑛Z ↠ Z/(𝑛/𝑝𝑟 )Z, i.e. 𝑦(𝑡) depends only on
      𝑡 (mod 𝑛/𝑝𝑟 ).
Proof. (1)⇔(2): Π is the Reynolds projector onto fixed points. (2)⇒(3): rotation invariance
imposes 𝑒 −2𝜋𝑖𝑘/𝑝 = 1. (3)⇒(4): only harmonics compatible with period 𝑛/𝑝𝑟 remain. (4)⇒(2):
                  𝑟


periodicity implies invariance under shift by 𝑛/𝑝𝑟 .

These equalities formalize the intuitive picture: Π 𝑝𝑟 keeps precisely the content invariant under
rotation by 𝑛/𝑝𝑟 , composes monotonically across tiers, commutes with rotations and with accents
only under a clear 𝑝-adic condition, intertwines predictably with subdivision, and generally
conflicts with within-cell permutations that remix residue classes.

Idempotence.            By group averaging or masks:
                                         1 ∑︁                1 ∑︁            1 ∑︁ 𝑤
                            Π 2𝑝𝑟 =                 R 𝑝𝑢𝑟              R 𝑝𝑣𝑟 =       R 𝑟 = Π 𝑝𝑟 ,
                                         𝑝𝑟   𝑢
                                                              𝑝𝑟   𝑣
                                                                                 𝑝𝑟 𝑤 𝑝

   c2 [𝑘] = 12 b
or Π                𝑥 [𝑘] = 1 𝑝𝑟 |𝑘 b
                                    𝑥 [𝑘].
             𝑝 𝑟 |𝑘


Self-adjointness. With the standard inner product ⟨𝑥, 𝑦⟩ = 𝑡 𝑥(𝑡) ⊤ 𝑦(𝑡), rotations are unitary,
                                                               Í

so Π 𝑝𝑟 is self-adjoint as an average of unitaries. In frequency, it is a real diagonal mask.

Orthogonal decomposition (same prime).                             For 𝑎 ≤ 𝑏,

                   Π 𝑝𝑎 Π 𝑝𝑏 = Π 𝑝𝑏 ,              Π 𝑝 𝑎 − Π 𝑝 𝑏 projects onto {𝑘 : 𝑝 𝑎 | 𝑘, 𝑝 𝑏 ∤ 𝑘 }.

Mixed primes.            For coprime 𝑝 ≠ 𝑞,

                                                  Π 𝑝 𝑟 Π𝑞 𝑠 = Π𝑞 𝑠 Π 𝑝 𝑟 = Π 𝑝 𝑟 𝑞 𝑠 ,

since 1 𝑝𝑟 |𝑘 1𝑞 𝑠 |𝑘 = 1 𝑝𝑟 𝑞 𝑠 |𝑘 .


A.4 Commutation with Rotations
For any 𝜙 ∈ Z,
                                        𝜙     1 ∑︁ 𝑢+𝜙                               𝜙
                              Π 𝑝𝑟 R 𝑝𝑟 =         R 𝑟 = Π 𝑝𝑟 ,                    R 𝑝𝑟 Π 𝑝𝑟 = Π 𝑝𝑟 ,
                                              𝑝𝑟 𝑢 𝑝
so range(Π 𝑝𝑟 ) is fixed-pointwise invariant under R 𝑝𝑟 .
    More generally, rotations commute as operators; hence Π 𝑝𝑟 commutes with any R𝑚 :

                                                        R𝑚 Π 𝑝 𝑟 = Π 𝑝 𝑟 R𝑚 ,

but only for 𝑚 = 𝑝𝑟 do we have Π 𝑝𝑟 R𝑚 = Π 𝑝𝑟 .

Noncommutation in general.

which vanishes iff Π 𝑝𝑟 [ 𝑝 𝑠 | ·] = [ 𝑝 𝑠 | ·].

Commutation condition.              Π 𝑝𝑟 [ 𝑝 𝑠 | ·] = [ 𝑝 𝑠 | ·] holds iff the comb [ 𝑝 𝑠 | 𝑡] is invariant under

                                  𝑛
                                     ≡0        (mod 𝑝 𝑠 )        ⇐⇒       𝑝 𝑟+𝑠 | 𝑛.

Equivalently, if 𝑣 𝑝 (𝑛) ≥ 𝑟 + 𝑠. In that case,

Special cases:
                                      (𝑞𝑛)
   • If 𝑝 ∤ 𝑞, then 𝑣 𝑝 (𝑞) = 0 and Π 𝑝𝑟 S𝑞 = S𝑞 Π 𝑝𝑟 .
                        (𝑞𝑛)
    • If 𝑝𝑟 | 𝑞, then Π 𝑝𝑟 S𝑞 = S𝑞 (the refined lattice is already invariant at level 𝑝𝑟 ).


A.7 Permutations Inside Cells
Let W𝑞𝜋 permute the 𝑞 children within each parent cell: ( W𝑞𝜋 𝑥)(𝑞𝑡 + 𝑢) = 𝑥(𝑞𝑡 + 𝜋(𝑢)). In
frequency, W𝑞𝜋 mixes the 𝑞-tuple of coefficients in each residue class 𝑘 ≡ 𝑟 (mod 𝑞) by a unitary
𝑈𝜋 (𝑟) that depends on 𝑟 and 𝜋. Hence
                                                     ∑︁
                        𝑝 𝑟 W𝑞 𝑥 [𝑘] = 1 𝑝 𝑟 |𝑘

                             𝜋

                                                  ℎ≡𝑘 (𝑞)


while                                        ∑︁
                        𝑞 Π 𝑝 𝑟 𝑥 [𝑘] =
                       W\                           [𝑈𝜋 (𝑘 mod 𝑞)] 𝑘,ℎ 1 𝑝𝑟 |ℎ b
                                                                               𝑥 [ℎ].
                        𝜋

                                          ℎ≡𝑘 (𝑞)

Unless 𝑝𝑟 divides all ℎ in the residue class 𝑘 mod 𝑞 (rare), the two differ; thus [Π 𝑝𝑟 , W𝑞𝜋 ] ≠ 0 in
general.


A.8 Equivalent Characterizations
For 𝑝𝑟 | 𝑛, the following are equivalent for 𝑦 ∈ X𝑛 :
   1. Π 𝑝𝑟 𝑦 = 𝑦.
   2. R 𝑝𝑟 𝑦 = 𝑦.
      𝑦 [𝑘] = 0 unless 𝑝𝑟 | 𝑘.
   3. b
   4. 𝑦 factors through the CRT projection Z/𝑛Z ↠ Z/(𝑛/𝑝𝑟 )Z, i.e. 𝑦(𝑡) depends only on
      𝑡 (mod 𝑛/𝑝𝑟 ).
Proof. (1)⇔(2): Π is the Reynolds projector onto fixed points. (2)⇒(3): rotation invariance
imposes 𝑒 −2𝜋𝑖𝑘/𝑝 = 1. (3)⇒(4): only harmonics compatible with period 𝑛/𝑝𝑟 remain. (4)⇒(2):
                  𝑟


periodicity implies invariance under shift by 𝑛/𝑝𝑟 .

                                           𝑝


These equalities formalize the intuitive picture: Π 𝑝𝑟 keeps precisely the content invariant under
rotation by 𝑛/𝑝𝑟 , composes monotonically across tiers, commutes with rotations and with accents
only under a clear 𝑝-adic condition, intertwines predictably with subdivision, and generally
conflicts with within-cell permutations that remix residue classes.

since R𝑛/𝑝 shifts by one parent cell; but for general 𝜏 not divisible by 𝑛/𝑝 commutation fails
(see B.3.2).

                           Define A𝛼,𝛿                            ⊤
Phase-offset accents.              𝑑 : 𝑥 ↦→ 𝑥 + 𝛼 1 𝑡≡𝛿 (mod 𝑑) 𝑒 1 . Then

This reparameterization isolates noncommutation as a phase change of the gate.


B.2 Identities Involving Projectors (Summary)
For completeness (see Appendix A for proofs):

                 Π 2𝑝𝑟 = Π 𝑝𝑟 ,    Π 𝑝𝑟 Π𝑞 𝑠 = Π 𝑝𝑟 𝑞 𝑠 ( 𝑝 ≠ 𝑞),            Π 𝑝 𝑎 Π 𝑝 𝑏 = Π 𝑝max(𝑎,𝑏) ,

                    Π 𝑝 𝑟 R𝑚 = R𝑚 Π 𝑝 𝑟 ,          Π 𝑝𝑟 A𝛼𝑝𝑠 = A𝛼𝑝𝑠 Π 𝑝𝑟 iff 𝑣 𝑝 (𝑛) ≥ 𝑟 + 𝑠,

and generally [Π 𝑝𝑟 , W𝑞𝜋 ] ≠ 0.


B.3 Counterexamples to Commutation (Concrete)
We use 𝑛 = 12 or 𝑛 = 18 for explicit vectors; take a single channel and denote the Kronecker
delta by 𝛿𝑡 .

B.3.1 [ W2(0 1) , A3𝛼 ] ≠ 0 on 𝑛 = 12. Let 𝑥 ≡ 0, A3𝛼 place ones at 𝑡 ∈ {0, 3, 6, 9}. With W2(0 1)
swapping within pairs (0, 1), (2, 3), . . . ,
                                              ∑︁                                         ∑︁
                         (0 1) 𝛼                                         (0 1)
                      W2      A3 𝑥 =                   𝛿𝑡 ,        A3𝛼 W2        𝑥=                 𝛿𝑡 .
                                       𝑡∈{1,2,7,8}                                    𝑡∈{0,3,6,9}


The supports differ; hence noncommutation.

B.3.2 [ R13 , W3(0 1 2) ] ≠ 0 on 𝑛 = 12. Cells of size 3 are (0..2), (3..5), (6..8), (9..11). Let 𝑥 = 𝛿0 .

                                    (0 1 2)
                                  W3          𝑥 = 𝛿1 ,        R13 (𝛿1 ) = 𝛿1+4 = 𝛿5 .



                                                              47
Conversely,
                                                             (0 1 2)
                                            R13 𝑥 = 𝛿4 ,   W3          (𝛿4 ) = 𝛿3 .

Outputs differ (𝑡 = 5 vs 𝑡 = 3).

B.3.3 [ S2 , A3𝛼 ] ≠ 0 without lift.           𝑛 = 12, 𝑥 ≡ 0. Then

                               S2 A3𝛼 𝑥 : ones at 𝑡 ∈ {0, 6, 12, 18} (mod 24),

but
                              A3𝛼 S2 𝑥 : ones at 𝑡 ∈ {0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21}.

They differ unless the lift rule (·) ↑2 is used.

B.3.4 [Π3 , W2(0 1) ] ≠ 0 on 𝑛 = 12.             Let 𝑥 = 𝛿0 . Then

                                    Π3 W2(0 1) 𝑥 = Π3 (𝛿1 ) = 31 (𝛿1 + 𝛿5 + 𝛿9 ),

while
                         (0 1)
                                 Π3 𝑥 = W2(0 1) 13 (𝛿0 + 𝛿4 + 𝛿8 ) = 31 (𝛿1 + 𝛿5 + 𝛿9 ).
                                                                  
                     W2

Here they coincide for 𝛿0 , but choose 𝑥 = 𝛿2 :

                                  Π3 W2(0 1) 𝛿2 = Π3 (𝛿3 ) = 31 (𝛿3 + 𝛿7 + 𝛿11 ),

                      (0 1)
                              Π3 𝛿2 = W2(0 1) 13 (𝛿2 + 𝛿6 + 𝛿10 ) = 13 (𝛿3 + 𝛿7 + 𝛿11 ).
                                                                 
                    W2

These also match; noncommutation appears for general mixtures. Take 𝑥 = 𝛿1 + 𝛿2 :

                          Π3 W2(0 1) 𝑥 = 13 (𝛿0 + 𝛿4 + 𝛿8 ) + 31 (𝛿3 + 𝛿7 + 𝛿11 ),

                                 (0 1)
                          W2             Π3 𝑥 = 31 (𝛿1 + 𝛿5 + 𝛿9 ) + 31 (𝛿3 + 𝛿7 + 𝛿11 ),

which differ.

         𝜙
B.3.5 [ R 𝑝𝑟 , A𝛼𝑝𝑟 ] ≠ 0 unless phase-offset is used.                 On 𝑛 = 108, 𝑝𝑟 = 27, 𝜙 = 1:
                                                                        ∑︁

                         = A27 R27 holds.



                                                            48
B.4 Identities Involving Relation Operators
                          split
Let 𝐻 = (𝑉, 𝐸, 𝜄), and 𝑄ˆ 𝑝 duplicate each edge 𝑒 into 𝑒 (0) , . . . , 𝑒 ( 𝑝−1) with copied incidence.

Split vs. additive accents on edge-aggregated channels. Suppose an edge channel aggregates
vertex signals by sum, and A𝛼𝑑 adds weight on a vertex channel at gate times. Then

                                             split              split
                                          𝑄ˆ 𝑝 ◦ A𝛼𝑑 ≠ A𝛼𝑑 ◦ 𝑄ˆ 𝑝

in general, because splitting before accent duplicates the aggregation targets and may double-count
at gate ticks; splitting after accent preserves a single aggregation per original edge.

Example (noncommutation). Let 𝑉 = {𝑣 1 , 𝑣 2 }, 𝐸 = {𝑒} with 𝜄(𝑒) = {𝑣 1 , 𝑣 2 }, 𝑛 = 6, and let
the edge signal be 𝜏(𝑒, 𝑡) = 𝜎(𝑣 1 , 𝑡) + 𝜎(𝑣 2 , 𝑡). Start with 𝜎 ≡ 0, apply A3𝛼 to 𝜎(𝑣 1 , ·).

                             split
                          (𝑄ˆ 2      ◦ A3𝛼 ) : 𝜏(𝑒 (0) , 𝑡) = 𝜏(𝑒 (1) , 𝑡) = 𝛼 [3 | 𝑡],

total edge mass 2𝛼 per gate.

                 split
      ( A3𝛼 ◦ 𝑄ˆ 2 ) : accent on 𝑣 1 once, then sum across split edges ⇒ total 𝛼 per gate.

         split
Thus [𝑄ˆ 2 , A3𝛼 ] ≠ 0.

Fold vs. rotation.     If 𝑄ˆ fold
                             𝑝 quotients 𝑝 cells by cyclic symmetry, then


                             𝑄ˆ fold 1   ˆ fold
                                𝑝 R𝑛/𝑝 = 𝑄 𝑝 ,               R1𝑛/𝑝 𝑄ˆ fold ˆ fold
                                                                      𝑝 ≠ 𝑄𝑝


on the pre-folded space, since the quotient kills the degree of freedom that the rotation would
otherwise act on.


B.5 Mixed-Prime Wreath Interactions
Assume 𝑛 divisible by 𝑝𝑞. Define W 𝑝 and W𝑞 using contiguous blockings of size 𝑝 and 𝑞
respectively. Then, in general,
                                             𝜌
                                    [ W𝜋𝑝 , W𝑞 ] ≠ 0.

Counterexample (𝑛 = 6, 𝑝 = 2, 𝑞 = 3). Let 𝑥 = (𝑥0 , . . . , 𝑥 5 ), 𝜋 = (0 1), 𝜌 = (0 1 2). Compute
within blocks:

                  𝜌
           W2𝜋 W3 𝑥 = swap within (0, 1), (2, 3), (4, 5) after cycling (0, 1, 2), (3, 4, 5),

                   𝜌
                 W3 W2𝜋 𝑥 = cycle within (0, 1, 2), (3, 4, 5) after swapping the pairs.


                                                        49
Coordinate expressions differ unless 𝑥 satisfies special symmetries.


B.6 Round-Up: When Do Things Commute?
                 Pair           Condition                      Outcome
                 R· , R·        always                   commute
                 A𝑑1 , A𝑑2      always (additive)        commute

                 R𝑛/𝑝 , W 𝑝     shift by parent cell     commute
                 R 𝑝𝑟 , A 𝑝𝑟    with phase-offset accent RA (𝛿) = A (𝛿+𝜙) R
                 Π 𝑝𝑟 , A 𝑝 𝑠   𝑣 𝑝 (𝑛) ≥ 𝑟 + 𝑠          commute
                 Π 𝑝 𝑟 , W𝑞     generic                  do not commute
                 S 𝑝 , R 𝑝𝑟     𝑝𝑟 | 𝑛                   commute after lift
                 S 𝑝 , A𝑞 𝑠     generic                  lift rule (·) ↑𝑝 required
                    split
                 𝑄ˆ 𝑝 , A𝑑      generic                  do not commute

B.7 Practical Note
In implementations, encode identities as rewrite rules in the execution planner:

                                                         S 𝑝 ◦ A𝑞𝛼𝑠 ⇒ ( A𝑞𝛼𝑠 ) ↑𝑝 ◦ S 𝑝 ,
                   𝜙                  𝛼,𝜙       𝜙
                  R 𝑝𝑟 ◦ A𝛼,0
                          𝑝𝑟 ⇒ A 𝑝𝑟 ◦ R 𝑝𝑟 ,


                  W 𝜋𝑝1 ◦ W 𝜋𝑝2 ⇒ W 𝜋𝑝1 ◦𝜋2 ,       Π 𝑝𝑟 ◦ Π𝑞 𝑠 ⇒ Π 𝑝𝑟 𝑞 𝑠 ( 𝑝 ≠ 𝑞).

Counterexample tests (small 𝑛 harnesses) should be part of unit suites to guard against accidental
operator reordering during kernel fusion.

The above APIs cover end-to-end workflows: lattice construction, operator authoring, evaluation,
resonance scoring, search/learning, diagnostics, and reproducible export. They encode the
calculus’ guarantees (tier structure, noncommutation) while providing practical levers for
implementation and deployment.


Appendix D. Extra Experiments and Full Tables

D.1 Experimental Settings
Unless noted, we use 𝑛 ∈ {48, 60, 72, 84, 90, 96, 108}, tiers D = {𝑝𝑟 ∥ 𝑛}, weights 𝜆 =
(0.4, 0.35, 0.25), tier weights 𝜂 𝑑 proportional to 𝑑. Each cell reports mean±sd over 5 seeds with
95% bootstrap CIs in parentheses. Gauge-fix: downbeat pin + CRT phase. Discrete search:
beam width 𝐵 = 32; continuous updates: 50 steps.

Each entry gives a terse rule (sutra), preconditions, rewrite, invariants, and a short example.
Rules act on a signal 𝑥 : T𝑛 → R𝑘 and, when stated, on a hypergraph 𝐻 = (𝑉, 𝐸, 𝜄). Composition
is right-to-left.




                                                 61
F.1 Structure Sutras (Subdivision, Permutation, Rotation)
S1. Factor–Unfold (S 𝑝 ).        Pre: 𝑝 prime. Rewrite:

                                 𝑋 ⇒ S 𝑝 𝑋,       ( S 𝑝 𝑋)( 𝑝𝑡 + 𝑢) = 𝑋 (𝑡).

Invariant: energy per parent cell preserved under zero-order hold. Example (108): S33 S22 builds
T108 from T1 .

S2. Off-Beat Swap (W2(0 1) ).       Pre: 𝑛 even. Rewrite:

                        𝑋 ⇒ W2(0 1) 𝑋, ( W2(0 1) 𝑋)(2𝑡 + 𝑢) = 𝑋 (2𝑡 + 1 − 𝑢).

Effect: inverts on/off within each binary cell. Example (108): apply after S22 for binary-first
syncopation.

S3. Hemiola Tilt (W3(0 2 1) ).     Pre: 3 | 𝑛. Rewrite:

                                           𝑋 ⇒ W3(0 2 1) 𝑋.

Effect: 1 → 3 → 2 within ternary cells; mild cross-tier tension. Example (108): insert before A9
to re-seat 𝐶1 beats.

                    𝜙
S4. CRT Lock (R 𝑝𝑟 ).      Pre: 𝑝𝑟 | 𝑛. Rewrite:

                                              𝜙
                                      𝑋 ⇒ R 𝑝𝑟 𝑋,        𝜏 = 𝜙𝑛/𝑝𝑟 .

Effect: aligns tier 𝑝𝑟 downbeat; commutes with Π 𝑝𝑟 . Example (108): choose 𝜙 to pin 𝐶0 at
𝑡 = 0.


F.2 Accent and Mask Sutras
S5. Cadence Gate (A𝛼𝑝𝑟 ).        Pre: 𝑝𝑟 | 𝑛. Rewrite:

                                       𝑋 ⇒ 𝑋 + 𝛼 [ 𝑝𝑟 | 𝑡] 𝑒 𝑐 .

Hierarchy: 𝛼27 > 𝛼9 > 𝛼3 for phrase clarity. Example (108): (27, 9, 3) on spine channel.

S6. Anti-Coincidence (X¬𝑑 ). Rewrite: ( X¬𝑑 𝑋)(𝑡) = (1 − [𝑑 | 𝑡]) 𝑋 (𝑡). Use: protect spine
                                      𝛾
while adding ornaments. Example: X¬3 A5 avoids ternary collisions.




                                                    62
S7. Spike Projector (Δ𝑑 ). Rewrite: (Δ𝑑 𝑋)(𝑡) = [𝑑 | 𝑡] · 𝑋 (𝑡). Use: force events to a tier or
compute class-restricted energies.

                                                         Í 𝑝𝑟 −1
S8. Level Averager (Π 𝑝𝑟 ). Rewrite: (Π 𝑝𝑟 𝑋)(𝑡) = 𝑝1𝑟 𝑢=0 𝑋 𝑡 + 𝑢 𝑛/𝑝𝑟 . Effect: keep only
                                                                       

content invariant under R 𝑝𝑟 ; diagnostics and separation.


F.3 Ornament Sutras (𝑝 = 5, 7)
                       𝛾
S9. Quint Overlay (A5 ). Rewrite: 𝑋 ⇒ 𝑋 + 𝛾 [5 | 𝑡] 𝑒 𝑜 . Option: X¬3 gate to preserve spine.
Example (108): light color every 5 ticks on ornament channel.

S10. Hept Drift (A7♭,𝛿 ). Pre: 7 ∤ 𝑛. Rewrite: pick 𝜇, 𝑠𝑛 s.t. 7𝑠𝑛 ≡ 1 (mod 𝑛), set
𝑆7 = {𝜇 + ℓ𝑠𝑛 },
                                 𝑋 ⇒ 𝑋 + 𝛿 1𝑡∈𝑆7 𝑒 𝑜 .

Option: update 𝜇 ← 𝜇 + 𝜌 per cycle for slow phase drift.


F.4 Relation Sutras (𝑄ˆ 𝑝 on 𝐻)
                split
S11. Split (𝑄ˆ 𝑝 ). Pre: 𝑒 ∈ 𝐸. Rewrite: 𝑒 ⇒ {𝑒 (𝑢) }𝑢=0 with 𝜄(𝑒 (𝑢) ) = 𝜄(𝑒). Use: parallel
                                                     𝑝−1

lanes for tier-specific aggregation.

               merge
S12. Merge (𝑄ˆ 𝑝 ). Pre: coherent siblings {𝑒 (𝑢) }. Rewrite: collapse to 𝑒 under conserved
sum on 𝜏. Use: reduce topology after ornament passes.

S13. Fold (𝑄ˆ fold
              𝑝 ). Rewrite: quotient 𝑝-cycle of vertices/edges by rotation. Effect: enforces
𝑝-periodicity; removes a degree of freedom.


F.5 Composition Sutras and Normal Forms
S14. Tiered Normal Form.       Rewrite schema:
                                            𝑟
                                           Ö                 
                                                       𝛼 𝑗
                           𝑃ˆ ( 𝑝) = S𝑟𝑝
                                                                    𝜙
                                                     A 𝑝 𝑝𝑗       R 𝑝𝑟   W 𝜋𝑝 .
                                    |{z}       𝑗=1                |{z} |{z}
                                   build   |     {z           }   lock   feel
                                                 gate


Note: order inside a prime is mostly exchangeable except W 𝑝 ; cross-prime order is not.

S15. Order Swap Test. Procedure: generate W, compute 𝑅; swap adjacent prime blocks,
recompute 𝑅; keep the better word. Repeat until no local improvement.



                                                 63
S16. Energy–Fairness Projection. Rewrite: 𝑋 ⇒ Proj{𝐸≤𝐸max , 𝐸 𝑝𝑟 ≤𝜂max 𝐸, 𝐹≥𝐹min } (𝑋) after
each epoch. Effect: enforces budgets without changing word structure.

Deterministic Paths and Seeds
All configs record:
    • global seed for splits and initialization;
    • beam-search seed for tie-breaking;
    • implementation flags: threads = 1, deterministic FFT, fixed PYTHONHASHSEED.
Re-run validation: python scripts/seed_report.py emits the per-epoch seed stream and
the tokenized operator word; verify equality against logs.


Licensing and Citation
Package-level license at repository root. Dataset licenses mirrored under data/LICENSES.
Include CITATION.cff so users can cite the package and the original datasets correctly.
This package yields byte-identical figures and tables from fixed seeds and pinned environments,
enabling exact reproduction of all reported results.
